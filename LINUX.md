# Aorus Laptop Fan Control (alfc) - Linux Guide

Linux pros - feel free to contribute either to the following guide or automating the 
workflow! ðŸ™‚ (See notes in the Wishlist section though.)

## IMPORTANT

**Only use this on Linux if your machine is listed in the compatibility table in the main readme or if you know what you're doing.**

Because on Linux, this tool writes directly to hardware addresses where data persists after rebooting. If something goes wrong, you might need to do something [like this](https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc/wiki/FAQ#is-there-a-way-to-reset-my-notebook-if-something-went-wrong).

As for how to figure out whether the addresses are the same on your machine â€“ not that simple, I might do a talk or write an article at some point. Let me know if you actually need this.

## Prerequisites

### Install Node.js 18

Needs to be runnable by root.

- Ubuntu/Debian https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#installation-instructions
- Arch https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Node.js#Installation

### Install `acpi_call`

This enables issuing fan control commands.

If you have secure boot enabled, you need to do [this](https://gist.github.com/s-h-a-d-o-w/53c2215e955c3326c6ec8f812a0d2f27) first. 

Download or clone https://github.com/nix-community/acpi_call (the `acpi_callback` version in your package manager might not be compatible or break [as it gets updates](https://github.com/s-h-a-d-o-w/alfc/issues/1)!) and run:

```
sudo make dkms-add
sudo make dkms-build
sudo make dkms-install
sudo modprobe acpi_call
```

#### Troubleshooting `acpi_call` installation

At least on Mint, I never needed the following but...

- `make` will tell you if you're missing compilers.

- You might need to install the headers for your kernel version: https://github.com/s-h-a-d-o-w/alfc/issues/6#issue-1218677080.

### Run `acpi_call` on startup

If your distro uses systemd, you can use [this really simple method](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_module#Automatic_module_loading_with_systemd). Just put `acpi_call` into `/etc/modules-load.d/acpi_call.conf`.

If it doesn't, I'm afraid you'll have to do research yourself.

## Installation

- Grab the latest alfc release
- Extract it to wherever you want the tool to live 
- Run `install.sh`.

  A service for alfc will be created and started.

- Go to `http://localhost:5522` to configure things.

### Installation troubleshooting

If you get an error like: `bin/sh: no command service`, try running the following:

```
sudo systemctl enable alfc
sudo systemctl start alfc
```

## Wishlist

- Somehow include `acpi_call` in the installation process. But there are two problems:
    1. People who have secure boot enabled need that whole separate step of signing the module.
    2. How the module can be loaded on startup might vary from distro to distro.
